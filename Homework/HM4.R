##  Data originated from the following questionnaire :
# I am going to read some things that people might say about their block. Each time I read one of these
# statements, please tell me if it is mostly true or mostly false about your block simply by saying "true" (2=MORE SOC) or "false" (1=LESS SOC).

# SCI1 - I think my block is a good place for me to live.
# SCI2 - People on this block do not share the same values. (reverse)
# SCI3 - My neighbors and I want the same things from the block.
# SCI4 - I can recognize most of the people who live on my block.
# SCI5 - I feel at home on this block.
# SCI6 - Very few of my neighbors know me. (reverse)
# SCI7 - I care about what my neighbors think of my actions.
# SCI8 - I have almost no influence over what this block is like. (reverse)
# SCI9 - If there is a problem on this block people who live here can get it solved.
# SCI10 - It is very important to me to live on this particular block.
# SCI11 - People on this block generally don't get along with each other. (reverse)
# SCI12 - I expect to live on this block for a long time.
#
# NOTE: Items 2,6,8,11 are reverse coded! This means that the loading on this item may
# be negative on the designated factor.

# assigning descriptive names to the variables
# varNames <- c(â€œvarname1", "varname2", ... , "varname12")  # To edit if you want more meaningful variable names

# print a correlogram of the correlation matrix using corrgram() function of the corrgram package, use default options (.5)

# customize the correlogram so that the lower triangle gives pie graphs and upper triangle shows the numerical values for the correlation (.5)

corrgram(R, upper.panel=panel.conf, lower.panel=panel.pie)
