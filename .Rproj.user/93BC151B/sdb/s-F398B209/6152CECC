Classifications. 1st generation. 2nd generation. New umbrella: Canonical Correlation -> Structural Equation Modeling. Multiple variables, dimensions, perspectives. Knife example. Reduce dimensions. Explore prespectives. \n\nMM is GLM with multiple outcomes. MM: Reduces number of DVs, improves measurement,  test theories. MM:  control type I error, relates DVs,  greater power, interpretations of DVs combination.\n\nGIGO. Garbage in = garbage out. Human mind will find patterns even in randomness.  Taxonomical approach to MM could be (?) confusing.  SEM took over multivariate hypothesis testing. Table of distinctions among MM. Fundamental matrices.\n\n\n### Thursday: Introduction to R and RStudio\n\n#### Scientist = data journalist\n\nWorking with data is becoming its own science.\n  - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)\n  - [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)\n  - [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034834.do)\n  \nIt's also becoming a high art:\n  - [Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)\n  - [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)\n  \n\nScientists work with data.   \nJournalists tell stories.   \n**Data journalists** tell stories of their data.  \nThey do with with **COMPUTER CODE**\n\n\nSTART WITH [a markdown simulator](https://demo.ocpu.io/markdownapp/www/). This Javascript app by  [Jeroen Ooms](mailto:jeroenooms@gmail.com) shows how computer code can be used to create an electronic report that uses  \n- text  \n- headings  \n- emphasis   \n- formulas \n- chunks of code\n- chunks of output\n- graph of data  \n- image linked from a remote location  \n\nWe can add other elements:  \n- minor emphasis  \n- other headings  \n- lists  \n- tables  \n- links to webpages  \n\n\n\n#### Strategic Goal \nTell a story about your data. \n\n#### Tactical Goal \nDevelop, evaluate, and interpret statistical models with which you tell a story about your data.\n\n#### Technical Assignment\nWrite a computer script that generates an electronic document reporting the statistical models with which you tell a story about your data.\n\n**create nice-looking and efficient reports with only computer script**\n\n",
