Classifications. 1st generation. 2nd generation. New umbrella: Canonical Correlation -> Structural Equation Modeling. Multiple variables, dimensions, perspectives. Knife example. Reduce dimensions. Explore prespectives. \n\nMM is GLM with multiple outcomes. MM: Reduces number of DVs, improves measurement,  test theories. MM:  control type I error, relates DVs,  greater power, interpretations of DVs combination.\n\nGIGO. Garbage in = garbage out. Human mind will find patterns even in randomness.  Taxonomical approach to MM could be (?) confusing.  SEM took over multivariate hypothesis testing. Table of distinctions among MM. Fundamental matrices.\n\n\n## Thursday: Introduction to R and RStudio\n\n### The working metaphor\n\nScientists are **data journalists** who tell stories of their data.     \nThey type text to instruct a *human* reader how to recreate the story his/her mind.  \nThey type text to instruct a *copmuter* how to manipulate data, evaluate models, print graphs, and  assemble output.   \n\n**Documents** that contain typed instructions for both human and computer consumption that recreate a story about the data are called **DYNAMIC**.\n\nSee an example of a dynamic document in this [markdown simulator](https://demo.ocpu.io/markdownapp/www/), created in javascript by  [Jeroen Ooms](http://jeroenooms.github.io/). \n\n**markdown** language uses special combinations of characters to make text strings appear differently: in bold, italics, as a heading, or as a name of the column in the table. This language is very simple and straightforward, but may take a little bid to get used to. To help you get proficient with markdown consider some of the following resources.  \n\n- [markdown guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) : a well-written \"breaking into\" guide. Gives ample verbal description. Recommended for newbies. By John Gruber.  \n- [markdown cheet-sheet](http://support.mashery.com/docs/customizing_your_portal/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet) : brief, simple, parallel view of what the code is doing.By Mashery group.   \n- [markdown in R](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.ca/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) : a blog entry on getting started with **rmarkdown** - a version of markdown enchanced for the use with RStudio.  By Jeromy Anglim.\n\n\nYou will need markdown to complete homework assignments and we won't spend any dedicated lab time on it, so please, pick it up on your own. \n\n\n### Goals in Data Science projects\nAdapting reproducible research standards, each project in data science could be conceptualized as having the following objectives:  \n\n- **Strategic Goal**   \nTell a *story about your data*. \n\n- **Tactical Goal**  \nDevelop, evaluate, and interpret statistical models with which you tell a *story about your data*.\n\n- **Technical Assignment**  \nWrite a computer script that generates an electronic document reporting the statistical models with which you tell a *story about your data*.\n\n\nWe'll have the total of **8 LABS**:  \n  \n  Date|Week|Class | Topic   \n-------|----|------|--\n  08 Jan | 1  |2 |**Lab 1** : Introduction to R   \n15 Jan | 2  |4 |**Lab 2** : Matrix algebra: basic operations   \n22 Jan | 3  |6 |**Lab 3** : Matrix Algebra to GLM     \n29 Jan | 4  |8 |**Lab 4** : Eigenvalues, decomposition, & inverses  \n05 Feb | 5  |10|**Lab 5** : Exploratory Data Analysis a& data screening  \n---|---|---|---\n  26 Feb | 8  |14|**Lab 6** : Exploratory Factor Analysis (Common factor model)\n12 Mar | 10 |18|**Lab 7** : Confirmatory Factor Analysis\n26 Mar | 12  |22|**Lab 8** : Structural Equation Modeling\n\nAs you see, the stories we'll tell will be technical: they will involve matrices and vectors, their transposes and inversions, decompositions, and projections. **markdown** will help us style text for human consumption, but all the instructions to the computer about what to do with matrices, datasets, and other objects will be given in  **R language**.  \n\nLearning enough **R language** in order to work with statistical models of multivariate data is the purpose of these 8 labs. \n\n### Learning R \n\n[A GOOD PLACE TO START LEARNING R](http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/) - terrific resouce by RStudio team collects the best online resources. Check out every link they mention, it's worth it. In fact, do it right now. \n\nNow we'll use one of the resources mentioned in the link above, [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html).  \nOpen your RStudio and execute the following code:  \n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"swirl\")  \ninstall.packages(\"Rtools\")  \ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")  \ndevtools::install_github(c(\"swirldev/swirl\", \"swirldev/swirlify\"))  \nlibrary(swirlify)  \n```\n\nFollow the prompt and complete the first lesson.\n\nI also recommend completing two free interactive courses at DataCamp: [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-r) and [Data Analysis and Statistical Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-analysis-and-statistical-inference_mine-cetinkaya-rundel-by-datacamp). Their content partially overlaps with the training by two availible courses by [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/students.html) package, but gives a different take and examples. \n\n### FOR INSPIRATION:  \n  \n  Working with data is becoming its own science:    \n- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1)  \n- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)  \n- [O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034834.do)  \n   \n   It's also becoming a high art:  \n   - [Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)  \n   - [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)  ",
