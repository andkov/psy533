Longitudinal Modeling
============

Accompanies a graduate course on longitudinal modeling (PSY-513) at the University of Victoria

The materials in the [Documentation](https://github.com/andkov/psy533/tree/master/Documentation) folder are organized handouts from [statpower.net](http://www.statpower.net) the website of James Steiger at Vanderbilt University. These and other resources can be found on the website of the [Multivariate Statistics](http://statpower.net/P312.html) course taught by him. 


[ShinyEFA](http://glimmer.rstudio.com/wibeasley/ShinyEFA/) is a web application created with [R](http://cran.rstudio.com/) and [Shiny](http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). It is created and maintained by [Andrey Koval](http://www.statcanvas.net) (University of Victoria) and [Will Beasley](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=48089881&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile) (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). 

ShinyEFA uses datasets from the [psych package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/psych.pdf) by William Revelle and [gradient projection algorithms](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/research/gpa/) by Bernaards and Jennrich. The original factor pattern matrices are obtained from an unrotated solution of the factanal function of the stats packages. Advanced factor functions by [James Steiger](www.statpower.net) are used for RMSEA diagnostic and [corrgram](http://www.datavis.ca/papers/corrgram.pdf) package by [Michael Friendly](http://www.datavis.ca/) from [York University](http://qm.info.yorku.ca/)
