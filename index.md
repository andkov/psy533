### Texts

- [An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis]() by Raykov, T. & Marcoulides, G.A , 2008. New York, NY: Routledge

- [A First Course in Structural Equation Modeling]() by Raykov, T. & Marcoulides, G.A ,2006. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.


### Course Description

This course will introduce you to a variety of multivariate techniques, primarily those with the goal of data reduction (principal components and factor analysis) and complex hypothesis testing (structural equation modeling). 

### Course Objectives

Learning statistical methods is like learning a language. One course will improve your ability to read and understand other peoples work. Becoming comfortable with the methods will require your use of them with data meaningful to you. In this course we will work on understanding when, why and how to implement a particular analysis, as well as how to interpret the product of the analysis.  Assignments are intended to help you become more comfortable with using syntax in statistical analysis software.
